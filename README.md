# UQ_WIFIuser_datamining
This is a data mining attempt under the master thesis project Citizen-centric Smart Campus, which is the first section (3 for all) I have done in my project. The scripts are divided into data_input and data_process. All the route is adjusted to the relative route (except the origin big size json data input) which you can use directly after download or clone.

## Matters need attention
The UQ wifi user data in one typical single day is a 7.62 GB Json file which is not so good to be upload here. So if you want to use this, feel free to skip the data_input.R file which is just making up data frame named DT.UQ.

## How to use
Download Rstudio, directly run the data_process.R line by line. The data_input file cannot be used line by line as you do not have the original uq-wireless-locations-w41-2018.json file.

## Further work
Email junquan.gu@uqconnect.edu.au for help or access of the User wireless network data.
